Jim Collins received his BS in Biology from Southeast          Missouri State University (2003) and PhD from Washington University in          St. Louis (2008). He did postdoctoral work with Phillip Newmark          (Howard Hughes Medical Institute) at the University of Illinois at          Urbana-Champaign. His research focuses on the basic biology parasitic          flatworms called schistosomes. These parasites infect more than 200          million of the world's poorest people, causing morbidity that rivals          global killers including Malaria and TB. Despite their devastating          global impact, only a single drug is available to treat schistosome          infection. As a postdoc Dr. Collins developed new functional genomic          tools to study these worms and using these tools discovered a novel          population of stem cells that are likely key to parasite survival          inside their human host. By studying these stem cells, and applying          large-scale functional genomic approaches, his work aims to develop          new therapeutic avenues to combat these devastating parasites. <strong></strong><br>          <strong></strong></div>        <a href="http://collinslab.org/#publications">Publications</a><strong><br>          <br>        </strong>        <hr><strong><a href="http://vivo.med.cornell.edu/display/cwid-kwd2001">Kirk

Thus var genes appear to be diversifying          much more rapidly than the rest of the genome. This process of          diversification involves frequent gene conversion events that are          initiated by DNA double strand breaks.<strong></strong><br>          <strong></strong></div>        <a href="http://vivo.med.cornell.edu/display/cwid-kwd2001#publications">Publications</a><strong><br>          <br>          <hr> <a href="https://www.unige.ch/medecine/mimo/en/groupes/773soldati-favre/g/sunil-doga/">Sunil

Petri, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. is the Wade Hampton Frost Professor        of Medicine and Chief in the Division of Infectious Disease at the        University of Virginia's School of Medicine (Virginia, U.S.A.). His        scope of research includes molecular parasitology, host defense and        Clostridium difficile in the lab at UVa,and in Bangladesh, India and        Pakistan studies of infant vaccines and undernutrition. Focusing on        amebic colitis, his lab identified the Gal/GalNAc-binding lectin of the        parasite Entamoeba histolytica that mediates contact-dependent killing        of host cells. Cell biologic studies of adherence, apoptosis and        endocytosis of human cells by the parasite are active areas of        investigation. DNA transformation of the parasite was pioneered in the        lab,and is used to study molecular pathogenesis. Clinically, the group        has developed FDA-approved antigen-detection tests that allow sensitive        and specific diagnosis of amebiasis. Using these tests in a now 10 year        study of 300 children in Bangladesh, acquired immunity to amebiasis was        discovered and demonstrated to be associated with interferon gamma and        mucosal IgA anti-lectin immune responses. A genetic polymorphism in the        leptin receptor, which is a regulator of T cell development, influenced        the development of immunity. We are pursuing these observations in a        murine model of disease. We are also developing an amebiasis vaccine,        and have just started an 8 country study of the role of enteric        infections, microbiome and human genome on child malnutrition and oral        vaccine failure. <br>        <a href="https://med.virginia.edu/faculty/faculty-listing/wap3g/">Publications</a><br>        <br>        <hr><strong><span></span><a href="http://www.izb.unibe.ch/research/prof_dr_isabel_roditi/index_eng.html">Isabel
