Jim Collins received his BS in Biology from Southeast          Missouri State University (2003) and PhD from Washington University in          St. Louis (2008). He did postdoctoral work with Phillip Newmark          (Howard Hughes Medical Institute) at the University of Illinois at          Urbana-Champaign. His research focuses on the basic biology parasitic          flatworms called schistosomes. These parasites infect more than 200          million of the world's poorest people, causing morbidity that rivals          global killers including Malaria and TB. Despite their devastating          global impact, only a single drug is available to treat schistosome          infection. As a postdoc Dr. Collins developed new functional genomic          tools to study these worms and using these tools discovered a novel          population of stem cells that are likely key to parasite survival          inside their human host. By studying these stem cells, and applying          large-scale functional genomic approaches, his work aims to develop          new therapeutic avenues to combat these devastating parasites. <strong></strong><br>          <strong></strong></div>        <a href="http://collinslab.org/#publications">Publications</a><strong><br>          <br>        </strong>        <hr><strong><a href="http://vivo.med.cornell.edu/display/cwid-kwd2001">Kirk

Thus var genes appear to be diversifying          much more rapidly than the rest of the genome. This process of          diversification involves frequent gene conversion events that are          initiated by DNA double strand breaks.<strong></strong><br>          <strong></strong></div>        <a href="http://vivo.med.cornell.edu/display/cwid-kwd2001#publications">Publications</a><strong><br>          <br>          <hr></strong>        <div style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong><a href="http://www.sfb1129.de/03-research-profiles/dr-friedrich-frischknecht/">Freddy
